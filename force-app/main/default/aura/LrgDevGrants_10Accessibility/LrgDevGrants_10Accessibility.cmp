    <h3>Technical information about this website's accessibility</h3>
    
    <p>The National Lottery Heritage Fund is committed to making its website accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
    
    <p>This website is not compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1AA standard. The non-accessible sections are listed below.</p>
    
    <h3>Non accessible content</h3>
    
    <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>
    
    <h4>Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h4>
    
    <p>Field labels do not announce properly when using NVDA and Firefox. This is non-compliant with WCAG Success Criterion 3.3.2 Labels or Instructions. We suggest NVDA users use the Safari browser to complete the form.</p>
    
    <p>We are investigating this issue and hope to implement a fix by August 2021.</p>
    
    <p>The number fields on several pages have restrictions about what can be entered. When a user tries to enter an inappropriate character, the field blocks this but does not tell the user what has happened. This is non-compliant with WCAG Success Criterion 4.1.3 Status Messages.</p>
    
    <p>We plan to correct this error by July 2021.</p>
    
    <h3>How we tested this website</h3>
    
    <p>We tested all of the pages of the funding application for grants over £250,000.</p>
    
    <p>The testing was done using a combination of NVDA, Voiceover, Firefox, Safari, Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.</p>
    
    <p>We tested:</p>
    
    <p>our application portal for grants over £250,000, available at <a href="https://heritagefund.force.com/get-and-manage-funding">https://heritagefund.force.com/get-and-manage-funding</a></p>
    
    <h2>What we're doing to improve accessibility</h2>
    
    <p>We are currently in the developing this application portal. It is being built and designed in line with WCAG 2.1 AA criteria and subject to continuous accessibility testing, and improvement.</p>
    
    <p>This statement was prepared on 13th May 2021.</p>
